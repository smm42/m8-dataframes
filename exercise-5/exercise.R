# Exercise 5: Gates Foundation Educational Grants

# Read data into a variable called `grants` using the `read.csv` function
grants <- read.csv('data/gates_money.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Use the View function to look at your data
View(grants)

# Create a variable `spending` as the `total_amount` column of the dataset
spending <- grants$total_amount

# Confirm that your `spending` variable is a vector using the `is.vector` function
is.vector(spending)

# Create a variable `org` as the `organization` column of the dataset.
# Unfortunately, it will not be a vector by default, so you must transform it using the as.vector function
org <- as.vector(grants$organization)

### Now you can ask some more interesting questions about the dataset.  Store your answers in variables ###

# What was the mean grant value?
mean(spending)

# What was the dollar amount of the largest grant?
max(spending)

# What was the dollar amount of the smallest grant?
min(spending)

# Which organization received the largest grant?
grants$organization[spending == max(spending)]

# Which organization received the smallest grant?
grants$organization[spending == min(spending)]

# How many grants were awarded in 2010?
length(grants$start_year[grants$start_year == 2010])
