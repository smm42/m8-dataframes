# Exercise 6: Popular Baby Names Over Time

# Read in the female baby names csv file into a variable called `female.names`
female.names <- read.csv('data/female_names.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Create a vector `year` as the year column of the dataset
year <- female.names$year

# Create a vector `name` as the name column of the datset
# As in the last exercise, you'll need to convert this column to a vector
name <- as.vector(female.names$name)

# Create a vector `prop` as the proportion column of the dataset
prop <- female.names$prop

# Create a vector `names.2013` as your name vector where your year vector is 2013
names.2013 <- name[year == 2013]

# Create a vector `prop.2013` as the your prop vector where your year vecctor is 2013
prop.2013 <- prop[year == 2013]

# What was the most popular female name in 2013?
name[prop == max(prop)]

# Write a funciton `MostPopular` that takes in a value `my.year`, and returns
# a sentence stating the most popular name in that year. 

MostPopular <- function(my.year) {
  propo <- female.names$prop[year == my.year]
  names.year <- female.names$name[year == my.year]
  return(names.year[propo == max(propo)])
}

# What was the most popular female name in 1994?
MostPopular(1996)

### Bonus ###

# Write a function `HowPopular` that takes in a name and a year, and returns
# a sentence with how popular that name was in that year

HowwPopular <- function(my.name, my.year) {
  years.maybe <- female.names$years[year == my.year]
  fem.names <- years.maybe[name = my.name]
  ret <- 
  
  return(year)
}

HowPopular <- function(my.name, my.year) {
  names.tmp <- name[year == my.year]
  prop.tmp <- prop[year==my.year]
  popular <- round(prop.tmp[names.tmp == my.name], 4)*100
  return(paste('The proportion of people named', my.name, 'in', my.year, 'was', popular))
}

# How popular was the name 'Laura' in 1995

HowPopular('Lisa', 1995)
