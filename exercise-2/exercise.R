# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have scored in each game this season (google "Seahawks")
points.scored <- c(12, 3, 37, 27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored against them in each game this season
points.allowed <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe
points <- data.frame(points.scored = points.scored, points.allowed = points.allowed)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points
points$diff <- points.scored - points.allowed

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom
points$won <- points.scored > points.allowed

# Create a vector of the opponents
opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Rams", "49ers", "Jets")

# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
row.names(points) <- opponents
